Jep 4.3 Release Notes
*********************
This release drops support for versions of Python older than 3.10.

Updates to PyConfig
*******************
`PyConfig <https://ninia.github.io/jep/javadoc/4.3/jep/PyConfig.html>`_ has
been updated so that the API maps directly to the PyConfig structure in the
Python C API which was introduced with
`PEP 587 <https://peps.python.org/pep-0587/>`_. Most of the existing methods
are now deprecated. The deprecated methods will continue to work as they did
before for now but they will be removed in a future release.
